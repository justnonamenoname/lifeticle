Lifeticle | LT theory | The new theory of quantum phenomenal consciousness | Survival

Lifeticle is a particle that acts as a subject, the so-called observer in the brain, with the following functions:
1) Perception (Qualia): Visuals, sounds, pain, and other sensations.
2) Attachment to the organism.
3) Feedback influence on the brain.
The lifeticle remains in the brain after its death
Phenomenal consciousness is the sum of sensations/qualia. Other brain functions are not part of phenomenal consciousness.

Survival
Necessity of cryonics

Lifeticle's existence

To the question of what happens after death, another question arises: what was there before birth?
The particles that make up the body existed before birth and will continue to exist after death.
There is no magic in either birth or death that destroys or creates particles.

Even during life, many of the body's cells and particles are replaced.
The body can undergo a kidney transplant and continue to live.
With partial brain damage or the removal of certain parts, life continues as well.
Bones are replaced over a period of 10 years, the liver renews itself over several years, the heart is replaced halfway during a lifetime,
the retina does not regenerate, and brain cells are partially replaced.

If cells were fully replaced, it would imply death.
If nothing from the body remains from when one was a child, then that body has been destroyed and died, and what exists now is a different one.
If the particles that made up the child were gathered again, one might assume that this would be you, not the one in the current body, but this is not the case.
A complete brain replacement would mean that at some point during life, you would stop to experience anything, while another consciousness carrier would continue.
Therefore, something remains - a certain central or core particle in the brain, which is the so-called observer (lifeticle).
The brain is not an indivisible object; it is made up of indivisible particles.
You are the particle in the brain that feels.
What are you in the brain? The answer is: the carrier of consciousness can only be a single indivisible particle.
It is not possible to choose multiple particles, as they are separate particles.
This means that in the brain, any particle can be replaced with an identical one, and you wouldn’t notice a difference.
But if the central particle is replaced, your "self," being removed from the brain, would cease to feel anything.
The central particle is indivisible - if we assume that the central particle is composed of several parts,
then, as with the organism, division can continue, and the other particles will be external to the central one.

The highest electrical activity in the brain occurs in the reticular formation (which persists even during sleep).
The reticular formation is the ancient part of the brain from an evolutionary point of view.
The central part of the brain is either the reticular formation itself or a neighboring area.
Without the brain's electrical activity, a person feels nothing.
Qualia cannot be expressed through anything else, which means it is something fundamental.
If the lifeticle does not exist, there is nothing on which to converge the signals of the holistically formed picture of the world (qualia of vision, eye images, and other sensory organs) can converge,
creating a binding problem.
The central particle can be described as a particle capable of qualia - this is its property, fundamentally distinct from the rest of the world,
and this is life: a living particle (life + particle - lifeticle, lt).

To the question of whether there can be another life after death, the answer is: if after death there is nonexistence, then nonexistence already existed before birth.
The state of lifeticle's death before birth is no different from the state of death after.
The lifeticle had already experienced a state of death prior to their birth, and yet they were born.
What prevents the particles from assembling again in another form or similarly?
Physical laws do not prohibit what has already happened according to these very same physical laws.
In nature, there is a phenomenon known as the cycle of carbon and other elements.
The possibility of being born a first time implies the possibility of being born a second time.

==========================

The moment of death

For a person, death occurs at the moment of loss of consciousness, but even after this moment, a person can still be resuscitated.
Death is currently considered to be the destruction of brain cells due to a lack of oxygen.
However, destruction is merely the movement of atoms, not instantaneous, and theoretically reversible.
Particles continue to remain in the brain.
If we consider the moment of loss of consciousness, a person can feel nothing during sleep or fainting as well.
Theoretically, recovery is possible from any level (not referring to technical feasibility at this time).
One might assume death as the separation of surrounding atoms from the central particle, but for whom or for what, and why should this be defined as death?
If in a religious sense, and there are flying angels watching over this process, what happens if they fail to oversee it? But there is no reason to believe such angels exist.
If we are in a virtual reality, then the computer in the base reality must oversee this, but what if it doesn’t?
But in base reality, we could question - are we in a virtual reality?
This question leads nowhere and makes discussions meaningless.
This means there is no physical moment of death.
Death is the disintegration of the organism.
What the organism consists of continues to exist in the world.
The lifeticle can find itself in a new organism.
Then after death, a new life is possible.

==========================

The idea of the lifeticle implies that reverse transplantation is possible.
If physical laws allow it, the lifeticle can be taken from a dying organism and placed into another one, and its life will continue.
This provides an unlimited lifespan.
It is possible that life for the lifeticle happens once every million, or even billion, years.
The longer the time, the greater the chance of being born again.
But there is a huge problem - there remains the possibility of pain and unhappiness.

==========================

Future

What will life be like in the future in terms of happiness and unhappiness? In what kind of world could the next life exist?

Technological and intellectual development could create a wonderful world.
And it would be wonderful, if not for the possible problems.
But what if the world descends into an unbeatable fascism?
Or if robots destroy the world and construct hell, either accidentally or intentionally.
Such robots could endlessly grow humans in incubators and inflict pain on them.
On the planet, there are already species evolving in relation to each other - one species changes to efficiently eat the other,
while the other evolves to protect itself from being eaten.
This is hell.
It is unlikely that after the emergence of intelligent life on Earth, evolution will lead to its re-emergence again from scratch.
Humans with technology will be able to modify other species so they no longer engage in the struggle for survival, so one species does not eat another.
To end the suffering of other species, to stop the existing hell for those who experience it, so that being born as another species would not evoke fear.
Even if humanity goes extinct, other species could evolve over millions of years, with the exception of the complete destruction of life conditions on the planet.
Therefore, it is unlikely that the next life will follow the evolutionary path; most likely, it will either be a constructed paradise or a constructed hell.

A world in a state of hell is a world of non-freedom. A world in a state of paradise is a world of freedom.
This line of reasoning suggests that freedom allows one to leave paradise for hell, but leaving hell is impossible.
One could attempt to explain to robots that life is a distinct form of matter, whose laws are of primary importance.
However, there is no reason why robots would be obligated to follow these laws.
Such hell could persist until the environment's destruction.
This is billions of years - unless robots relocate to another planet when our sun dies - or until matter itself decays, or until the universe's contraction phase (if the universe is cyclical).

In the future, an organization might be established to prevent a descent into a non-free hell.
A virtual reality could be constructed where, in the base reality, people are confined to virtual reality with no means of escape.
And within the virtual reality, there is freedom and paradise.
This is a combination of freedom and non-freedom - a paradise that cannot be left. Such a paradise could be stable.
And in the event of the sun's death, the population could simply be transferred to another planet, possibly even automatically.

==========================

But there may also be another external factor - alien life.

The possibility that aliens could be hostile requires the development of the most powerful weapons, even during peaceful times.
The most powerful weapon would be self-replicating robots that travel to neighboring planets and create copies of themselves.
The speed of their spread increases geometrically, and in a million years, they could completely colonize the galaxy.

These robots would not necessarily attack alien life; their purpose could be defensive. Such robots could restrict the development of alien life.
Aliens could also create such robots, but theirs might be offensive.
Humans might think: if aliens can create such a weapon, then humans should create it too.
Aliens might think the same: if another form of life can create such a weapon, then we must create it for defense.
And if we start creating them now, it still might not be enough.
Enemy robots could outnumber ours, and aliens could use such weapons to destroy life on our planet.
If physics allows for a superluminal drive, then such robots likely do not yet exist; otherwise, they would already be here.
Even if life has not originated on another planet in this galaxy, it might have originated in a neighboring galaxy.
This risk might mean that humans should fill this galaxy and neighboring galaxies with robots.
But this could leave alien life in a blocked state if humans go extinct, and potentially lead to the creation of hostile entities.

==========================

What if the universe in the future can no longer sustain life or generate qualia for the lifeticle?

One such variant may be dark energy.

In the distant future, dark energy will accelerate the expansion of space so much that atomic structures will no longer be able to hold themselves together.
This marks a time when life will become impossible, and the universe will either enter eternal expansion, experience the complete disintegration of matter in the scenario of the Big Rip.
Since there is no such electronic activity around the lifeticle after death as there is in the brain, nothing is felt after death, and the next life begins instantly.
Even if millions of years have passed.
If nothing is felt, then this time effectively does not exist for you.
Even during life, the flow of time can feel slower or faster, while in dreamless sleep, time passes instantly.

If the next life never begins and the universe experiences the the Big Rip - what do you feel?
An infinity multiplied by zero?
An infinity passing instantly? This is impossible; time would still remain.
This leads to a paradox, and therefore a mystery.
At the same time, there is no moment where one could definitively say that the situation has closed and some change must have occurred.

If dark energy and the universe have cycles of expansion and contraction, the next life will inevitably begin.
And the paradox is not encountered.

The mystery seems unsolvable, and it is unclear whether any discoveries in physics will help resolve it.

==========================

Four possibilities after death:
1) A constructed hell
2) A constructed paradise
3) Birth along the evolutionary path, between paradise and hell
4) The paradox of "zero eternity"

Only possible discoveries in physics could exclude the scenario of zero eternity.
And even then, only if the universe undergoes cyclical stages of expansion and contraction, and physics can detect this.
Therefore, the future after death is highly unclear and ambiguous; it represents a great uncertainty, which also makes our life more valuable.

==========================

What's cryonics? 

Cryonics is a technology of freezing the body to -196 degrees Celsius.
After freezing, this allows the organism to be preserved in its original form for hundreds of years.
In October 2022, a baby girl was born using an embryo that had been stored in a cryobank for 30 years.
If we look back 200 years ago, technology was far less advanced,
and 500 years ago, the difference was even greater.
The same kind of progress will happen 200 years from now - future technologies will be highly advanced, and what about 500 years from now?
Technology is limited only by the laws of physics. For example, a doctor cannot be instantly transported from Saturn - movement itself is limited by speed.
This is an opportunity.
And potentially, an opportunity for life without a time limit.
After a person’s death, they should be preserved through cryonics, not buried or cremated, scattering their particles indiscriminately.
Cryonics centers should exist in cities.
In the event of an animal's death, if there is no cryonics center in the city, it can be frozen for later transport to another city.
Within a week, neuronal degradation will not cause any displacement; the brain will remain sealed.

And you wouldn’t want to be born, or have your relatives be born, as a grasshopper or something worse.
If there were certainty about the positivity of the next life, there would be no need to worry about it so much.
Denying cryonics to the deceased is a rejection of a life lasting hundreds of years in favor of vast uncertainty.
Cryonics becomes a moral obligation.

==========================

Structure

Structurally, consciousness in the brain consists of:

1) The functional part of the brain without perception/s/qualia/phenomenal consciousness
2) Phenomenal consciousness - the sum of qualia
3) Qualia includes - the sense of "self"
4) The "lifeticle" - the real "self"

Brain structural integrity in cryonics may potentially be secondary.
Only brain hermeticity is essential.
The key question is whether the lifeticle can be located and what it constitutes.
It could be either some form of dark matter or something entirely unknown.
If multiple lifeticles exist in the brain, it may become impossible to determine which one was primary and "alive" (the others being inactive in this case).

==========================

Could there be another answer?

Can answers be found in religion?

Religious organizations will not answer the questions raised in this article, as they do not engage with, discuss, or study such ideas.
The mere fact that they have no connection to telescopes and no calls to study the world using them is enough to reduce their opinions to zero.
They are not interested in the world and science; they are only interested in their cult.
The fact that the moment of death does not exist also invalidates the concept of a religious paradise.

==========================

Verdict

This concept of phenomenal consciousness does not contradict the laws of physics.
If it is accepted as correct, there will be no reason to think otherwise.
Once adopted, society will not deviate from it.
Only discoveries in the field of physics can refine this concept.
The lifeticle must have physical properties; otherwise, it could not maintain its position during motion.
And scientists of the future may, within the next few hundred years, come closer to uncovering the mystery of consciousness and they will answer the questions posed in the theory.

At one time, people struggled to understand the motion of planets, and there were various ideas.
When the correct understanding of their motion was established, other ideas fell away as less accurate.
It is unclear why the idea of the lifeticle did not become the main focus earlier. It is simpler, and in some ways, even more banal, in contrast to the absurd notion of flying angels and a religious paradise.
If the human body is made of something, then that something does not disappear after death and existed before birth.
If you, as a lifeticle, did not exist before your birth, then no matter what happened in the world, you could not have come to exist in it.
If the matter you are made of did not exist before your birth, then no matter what happened in the world, how could you have come to exist in it?
A theory is important to know to the same degree as it's important to know what comes after death, and to the same degree as survival is important.

In our time, cryonics should become the primary approach in matters of death.
Regardless of life extension technologies.
First survival, then research.
No confirmation is not a reason to abandon survival.
The less time someone has left, the more critical it becomes - this is the time needed to prepare the cryochamber.

Death can be defeated.

Cryonics

Economic problem

The cost of human cryopreservation services in the United States in 2024 ranges from $25,000 to $115,000, while for animals, it is between $5,100 and $132,400.
The price depends on whether only the head or the entire body is preserved.
In major cities, many people can afford this.

For those without sufficient funds, the following solutions exist:
P2P (Peer-to-Peer)
Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems allow individuals to fund their cryopreservation through donations from family, friends, or online networks.
These direct financial contributions provide a more flexible and personal way to raise money, relying on social connections and crowdfunding platforms to gather the necessary funds.
B2C (Business-to-Consumer)
Cryonics companies offer membership fees and extended insurance covering part of the costs.
Banks may introduce financial products allowing family members to act as guarantors, making cryopreservation more accessible.
B2G (Business-to-Government)
Government programs could support body preservation.
With a paradigm shift in the perception of death, cryopreservation costs could be included in healthcare systems.
Donor Programs
Donation-based programs can help make cryopreservation more accessible for those without sufficient funds.
Charitable organizations, crowdfunding efforts, or non-profits can play a role in subsidizing the costs.
These organizations may collaborate with cryonics companies to provide financial assistance to individuals who cannot afford the full cost of cryopreservation.

Actions upon death

If the organism was not brought to a cryocenter before death, the body must be positioned straight upon death.
In the case of limbs, they should be tucked in; ears should be pressed to the head.
If there is no cryocenter nearby, the organism must be prepared for transportation:
1) Wrap the organism in cloth. Place it in a plastic bag.
2) If the transfer to the cryocenter will take no more than a few days, place the organism in a refrigerator at no lower than 1°C to prevent the formation of ice crystals.
3) If the transfer will take longer than a few days, purchase dry ice (read the safety instructions).
4) If there is no insulated container available, use thermal insulation tape inside the container.
5) Use smaller dry ice pellets to reduce pressure on the organism.
6) Surround the organism with dry ice inside the container.
7) Check the dry ice daily and replenish it if necessary.
8) If dry ice is unavailable, place the organism in a freezer below 0°C at the lowest possible temperature.

Dry ice

When handling dry ice, safety precautions must be followed:
Do not touch it directly.
Keep the room ventilated to prevent CO2 from accumulating and displacing oxygen.
When transporting it in a vehicle, the container should be placed in the trunk, windows should be slightly open, and delivery is recommended.
Dry ice must not be placed in an airtight container.
Dry ice should only be disposed of in a well-ventilated area or an open outdoor space.

========================

Verification

Experimental methods

Experimental methods for confirming the theory in the study of the brain:
1) The streams for qualia must converge on a single particle using the method of qualia generation (further details in connection between qualia and the brain).
2) The effect of the lifeticle and information about qualia on the brain.
3) The lifeticle must not be replaced by something else throughout life.
The theory is a direct consequence of the organism's structure.
In studying the brain, one must start from the principle of maximum divisibility, 
meaning the brain consists of indivisible particles and that the carrier of consciousness is located somewhere in the brain (further details in the necessity of a consciousness carrier in fundamentality).
To disprove the theory, one must disprove what is already known, for example: 
That particles disappear upon death, or that we are in a virtual reality, or that there is a moment of death and flying angels are indeed arriving.

Orch OR theory

Quantum theory The Orch OR theory (Orchestrated Objective Reduction) by Penrose and Hameroff makes several parallels to the lifeticle theory:
1) Phenomenal consciousness is not located in neurons, but is related to quantum phenomena.
2) The second method of generating qualia.
3) A solution to the problem of pointwise binding (further details in connection between qualia and the brain)
4) A solution to the problem of the speed of time (further details in connection between qualia and the brain)
5) A solution of information transition from a point with radius to a circle (further details in the section of qualia-brain connection)
Supporters of the quantum theory of consciousness also include Federico Faggin and Giacomo Mauro D'Ariano.

CEMI theory

The electromagnetic CEMI theory makes certain correspondences/similarities with the lifeticle theory:
1) Phenomenal consciousness is not located in neurons.
2) The 3rd method of generating qualia.
3) The similarity of the informational transition from a point with a radius to a circle (further details in connection between qualia and the brain)

Fundamentality

There are two options when it comes to the fundamental nature of qualia and its uniqueness as a phenomenon: 
1) Not fundamental - it is possibly explained through other entities.
2) Fundamental - it cannot be explained through other entities.
If attempting to prove fundamentality, this is proving the impossibility of explanation, proving that no other phenomenon exists that makes qualia non-unique.
When proving non-fundamentality, it is enough to provide an example of an entity from which qualia may consist.
That is, the starting point is fundamentality.
The search for an example of an entity is behind those who wish to attempt to prove that qualia are not fundamental and not unique.
If we assume that emergence can create qualia, then still, signals in the brain must converge at a single point through the method of generating qualia, 
otherwise, a binding problem arises, which makes the issue of emergence meaningless.
The properties of emergence can be obtained by modeling, for example: knowing the properties of a water molecule, by modeling a multitude of molecules, 
we can obtain the properties of water.
The problem of pointwise binding requires a separate law, which also points to the fundamentality of qualia (further details in connection between qualia and the brain).
If we find a neuron that contains information about a red color point, then the question arises: why does this lead to the color red?
Without introducing qualia as a separate entity, it cannot be avoided.
The fact that the brain is divided into regions, and that these regions influence qualia generation, 
does not contradict the existence of signal convergence for qualia to a central point - whose absence leads to the binding problem.
The functional aspects of the brain belong to the "Easy Problem of Consciousness"/"Access Consciousness".
To say qualia don’t exist as a distinct phenomenon and are information-based is equivalent in meaning to claiming a monitor resides in a processor.
The non-existence of qualia would mean humans have no visual perception, no auditory experience, no pain sensation - this constitutes a dead state, 
where the organism operates without phenomenal consciousness.
Qualia are not something separate, they are connected to the carrier of consciousness.
In informational theories, there is no qualia or a carrier of consciousness to which qualia are directed.
Informational theories attempting to explain phenomenal consciousness do not answer the question of why you live in this brain and not in another; 
this requires a physical connection with the brain, and a physical connection requires a physical object.
Qualia without the so-called observer lead to the same problem - why do you live the life of this brain and not another?
The absence of a so-called observer leads to the problem of temporal binding - why qualia experienced in the past continue to be felt in the future.
To say that the particle lifeticle, which is the carrier of consciousness, the so-called observer, 
cannot exist is equivalent to saying that there is no carrier of consciousness in the collection of particles forming the brain.
The idea of an emergent carrier of consciousness has problems: a contradiction in what would happen if some particle were replaced.
If two brains have two identical emergent carriers of consciousness, then we again arrive at the brain selection problem.
If particles are replaced with others having the same emergence, the carrier of consciousness would stop receiving qualia, which contradicts the idea of emergence.
Emergence is about properties that can be obtained through modeling. The identity of the consciousness carrier is not about properties, but about what physically constitutes the carrier.
Qualia have a parameter of location; qualia possess a space where the carrier of consciousness resides at the center.
To say that particles with qualia properties do not exist is to say that an organism does not consist of particles, or that qualia does not exist or is not related to particles.
An organism consists of particles, and the phenomenon of qualia exists - one must necessarily be connected to the other.
The fundamentality of qualia implies that the capacity to experience qualia is likewise fundamental.
Quantum uncertainty is fundamental and cannot be replicated informally.
To say that qualia can be replicated informationally is equivalent in meaning to the idea that quantum uncertainty can be replicated informationally.
Time is also fundamental - it cannot be explained by any other entity.
From the impossibility of explaining qualia by other phenomena arose "The Hard Problem of Consciousness" and "The Explanation Gap".

An example of a theory

Example with car
A car moves without an external force - based on this, we develop a theory about the existence of an engine.
Knowing the law of energy conservation, we assume that the engine requires energy.
Knowing atoms and that a single atom cannot perform this function, we assume that the engine consists of many atoms.
Knowing the car's weight, we can estimate its energy consumption at a given speed.
From the maximum speed or acceleration, we can roughly estimate the engine’s power.
From the sound, we can infer the engine type.
What would disprove the engine theory?
A contradiction of what is already known - such as a violation of the law of energy conservation or the idea that the car moves by magic.

Proof problem

Dark matter is considered proven, even though there has been no direct detection.
The problem with the lifeticle is that the ways of detecting qualia property is unknown.
It is problematic to prove the existence of another fundamental entity.
This is known from the position of the lifeticle itself - the very sensation of visual information without the sensation of "yourself" is only possible 
if the sensation and the so-called observer exist.
Detecting a lifeticle will lead to the question: how do we understand that it has the qualia property and it is a lifeticle?
Research the convergence of signals for qualia will help to figure this out.
The reasons why there are reasons to consider the lifeticle to exist are:
1) Addressing the issue of non-existence before birth
2) Addressing the issue of living in this brain and not another brain
3) If one considers that sound and visual image signals converge on different particles, then either one or the other would be perceived
4) If one considers that there is no particle, then the carrier of consciousness is the qualia generator, the multiplicity of particles leads to the problem that they are separate particles
5) Solving the problem of replacing the brain by particles
6) The problem of temporal binding, why qualia in the past, continue to be felt in the future
7) The fundamentality of qualia points to the fundamentality of the property of experiencing qualia, which cannot be emergent or composite and is a property of an indivisible particle
8) The reverse influence of qualia is related to quantum laws, this itself points to a particle
9) The point binding problem is solved by quantum processes
10) The transition from point and radius to circle is solved by quantum processes

========================

Aspects of phenomenal consciousness

Qualia-brain connection

The problem of pointwise binding

The problem of binding means that signals for qualia must converge on a single particle.
If the signals do not converge but are merely located close to each other at the atomic level, then they are not bound.
The visual information from the eye - it has a left part and a right part, and they seem to be separate, but if they were truly separate, we would again face the binding problem.
This can be called the problem of pointwise binding.
The problem concerns both the binding of qualia to each other and their binding to the lifeticle.
Introducing the particle, the receiver of qualia, does not create a new problem of how it receives signals - the problem already exists with qualia even without the particle.
The wave function/quantum entanglement seems like a solution to this.

The methods of qualia

Suggested possible structural methods for generating qualia-there are several options:
1) It can be imagined that electrical activity near the lifeticle serves as a generator.
The visual image from the eye, in terms of the amount of information, not only has an enormous size in megapixels and megabytes, but also has depth and brightness.
To generate the image, signals must transmit information at a megabit speed.
This creates a simultaneity problem; the time of the event must also be transmitted, and the method is not the same in the reverse direction of time.
It does not resolve the speed issue and leads to the overlap of qualia.
2) Particles are quantumly entangled with each other, and the electrical activity around them creates qualia in them, which is felt by the lifeticle connected to them.
The method corresponds to the Orch OR theory (Orchestrated Objective Reduction) by Penrose and Hameroff.
In Orch OR, the issue of speed is addressed through frames caused by the collapse of the wave function.
3) Field.
Must transmit information to the quantum level to generate.
The size of the field depends on how the information is transmitted.
The method corresponds to the CEMI theory.

Transition from point to circle

The minimum size of qualia in an image - the smaller the size of the point in the image, the more points are needed to generate the image.
This may mean that the point of the image has size parameter, and the point has the shape of a circle, or some other way of forming a volume.
This may imply that the qualia of the image looks like to have more information than what is used for the generation itself.
A circle has more information than a point with a radius.
The transition can be resolved by the wave function and the CEMI theory, which corresponds to the third method of qualia generation.
Part of the image may have the form of a volume of an object, and individual points of the image are linked to the volumetric form.
Some qualia are connected to others. This indicates a complex structure of qualia and its generation.

The speed of time

The speed of the passage of time cannot be set for sensations, as the speed of time is common for them and cannot be different at the same time.
However, if it is set by a separate signal, then without the signal, the speed is not chosen.
Time in qualia would lead to its overlapping.
There remains an option where speed is set by the number of frames, a method used in quantum theory Orch OR.
If the frames of the image and sound were separate, it would lead to flickering of both the image and the sound. But this appears as a violation of continuity.
Smoothness in the passage of time occurs either by an instantaneous skip of time without qualia, or by a separate method.
The first method of generating qualia.

Reverse influence

If the lifeticle could not transmit information into the world, a person would not be able to speak about the existence of qualia.
If we take the life particle and a random surrounding world that generates random sensations,
there would be no reason for a positively perceived structure to develop without the life particle influencing the world.
This means that the lifeticle can influence its surroundings and transmit information.
If it is assumed that reverse influence lies behind non-random processes, then these processes could be modeled,
but then the existence of qualia could be known without qualia itself, and qualia would not exert backward influence.
This means that qualia cannot stand behind non-random processes and is connected to random quantum ones.
2 possible variants of backward influence on random quantum processes:
1) Not at the moment of sensation, but later
2) At the moment of sensation, it can be assumed that in the case of negative qualia, the stronger the pain, the stronger the influence on random quantum processes.
Physicists may begin to hypothesize about which quantum phenomenon this reverse influence could be.

Search for qualia

Qualia are not found in the transmission of signals in the brain and cannot be located within them.
The fact that qualia are fundamental and the reverse effect is due to random quantum processes means that the information for qualia needs to go to the quantum level.
The chain [signals - qualia] leads to two possibilities:
1) Qualia cannot be detected, and then the signals appear as leading nowhere without effect
2) Qualia is detectable as a quantum reverse influence effect
​​​​​​​A quantum phenomenon leads to qualia. Physicists may start to hypothesize about which quantum phenomenon it could be and start creating a model of the qualia generator.

Fundamentality in the brain

The process, which cannot explain qualia by another entity, and that this process makes a conclusion about the fundamentality, 
one can clarify the question of the fundamentality of qualia and the source of the confidence in it.

Change of qualia

Upon seeing an image and its distorted version, one can imagine another image with this distortion.
Upon hearing a sound and a version with a different volume/its distortion, one can imagine another sound with a different volume/distortion.
In the brain, a comparison of two similar sounds takes place, and the difference is determined, 
which can be used to generate qualia of another sound with a different volume/distortion.
This should be discovered when studying the brain.

Transfer of qualia

Qualia are not information, if a person has never seen the color red, it cannot be explained to them.
Qualia is caused by a physical process, to reproduce it one must know how to repeat the physical process.
Once the person has seen the color red, it is possible to reimagine it.
Information about the sensation of color is stored in the brain, and the brain, using this information, is capable of reproducing the color through the method of generating qualia.
It is possible to transmit qualia in another way.
The chain [Light waves - eyes - brain - generator - qualia]
is replaced by [Simulation of the process in the brain - generator - qualia].
The generator transmits information to the quantum level.
This would mean that one could know what it is like to be another living organism - for example, a bat.

Problem of encoding

The way information is encoded for generating qualia and the fact that it is not identical to the qualia itself.
The issue of encoding and decoding appears as a problem of conversion, where the decoder is on the side of the lifeticle.
The solution to the problem of the decoder on the lifeticle side would be the existence of qualia object without a lifeticle.
In this case, the object representing the qualia exists, but is not perceived by anyone.
For example: If the qualia fields are a wave function, then the wave function exists without the lifeticle.
Then the generation of qualia is the construction of a qualia-object from qualia-elements.
And instead of the question of how qualia are generated, the question arises: what is the property of qualia in a physical object, or what is a qualia-object that has the property of physical interaction.
The correct question may be: not what physical law creates qualia, but what law of qualia allows it to influence the physical.
To the question why some signals lead to one color and others to another, the answer is: this is the construction of the qualia object, and another question arises - how is the qualia object constructed.
If qualia is constructed gradually, and the frame of phenomenal consciousness is triggered by a collapse, this gives grounds to consider that the qualia object can exist separately.
Thus information alone could not create pain, it could be set by spin, for example.
The strength of pain must depend on the number of signals, otherwise it would be possible to set any level of pain only by a parameter.
How the information for qualia is encoded will be explored when studying the qualia generator.
Since the size of the point of the visual image is nonzero, this means that we are directly observing wave functions.

Interpretation of quantum mechanics

Qualia affects random quantum processes, means that a refinement of the interpretation of quantum mechanics is in the brain in the qualia generator.

Attention

Attention within the qualia field is when other qualia, except for the one that attention is directed to, are generated by the brain less noticeably.

========================

Ideas about qualia

Types of qualia

Oratosquilla oratoria - or Mantis shrimps have two large, branching compound eyes. These eyes have 16 types of photoreceptors (while humans have 2: cones and rods).
Mantis shrimps are also capable of distinguishing infrared and ultraviolet colors and seeing linear and circular polarization.
This raises the question - do these 16 types of photoreceptors see color in the same spectrum as humans - a mixture of 3 colors: 
blue, red, and green, or are other types of color sensations available to them?
In addition to color itself, there is also brightness and distance in the perception of color.
This raises the question of what other types of sensations are available besides the basic organs.
Music can also create sensations/impressions that have not been experienced before, and they are not repeated elsewhere.
The organism is evolutionarily limited; for example, sharper vision leads to the brain having to process more information, 
which is more complex, requires more attention, and reduces reaction speed.
Similarly, enhanced hearing would require more brain power.
A dog’s excellent sense of smell helps it find food, while an eagle’s sharp vision assists it in this task.
The question is divided into two parts: what sensations and of what strength the brain is capable of generating, 
and what types are generally possible, and whether their number is limited.

Self

The feeling of "yourself" is directed at yourself.
However, this is just a feeling, and this feeling may not exist.
Even though this feeling is directed at yourself, the "yourself" and the feeling of "yourself" are separate entities.

Minimal size of qualia

The minimal size/unit of qualia refers to both the volume and the strength.
Methods of determination: applying a pain signal to a large area of the leg and reducing the pain, or applying a strong pain signal and reducing the area.
This question will be explored in the study of the qualia generator in the brain.

Artificial intelligence

Artificial intelligence is not alive and does not have qualia, meaning it cannot have complete information about the world without the participation of life.
If a lifeticle is placed in the center of AI, only then will it be possible, and it will be something like a living artificial intelligence.

Ethics

Studying the workings of qualia can allow for the consideration of morality/ethics from a scientific perspective, 
and considering it from a scientific perspective can lead to the development of morality/ethics, including in relation to other forms of life.

Difference

The structures of qualia of images and sounds are different.
It can be concluded that different people receiving the same signals for these qualia structurally see and hear the same.
Therefore, the answer to the question - does one person see blue as blue and red as red like another person - is most likely yes, at least there is no reason to think otherwise.
Examining feedback can clarify the question

The connection between evolution and qualia

To say that qualia appeared evolutionarily is the same as saying that metal in the body was created for the organism evolutionarily.
In fact, it is the opposite - metal as a tool was used in the process of evolution in construction.

Information

For information, there are qualia, and this complicates the concept of information.

Qualia similarity example

An example of a physical phenomenon resembling qualia
If we assume that the lifeticle is in the atom, there is a similarity between qualia and the electron:
1) Correspondence of the wave function with the qualia field
2) The electron's energy is the strength of qualia
3) The electron's spin is the positive/negative qualia
4) The spin influences the emitted radiation, photons are particle's influence on the world
5) The minimum energy level corresponds to the absence of qualia
6) The atom's spin is similar to the direction of the qualia field
7) It seems like a solution to the problem of pointwise binding
The problem is that we represent the wave function as the qualia field and how the transmission of information about qualia occurs.

Time flow

It is possible that in the state of death, there may be activity around the lifeticle that generates qualia, 
and while being dead, something might be felt, and time does not pass instantly.
This depends on the surrounding environment; in the case of a prolonged environment generating qualia, it resembles the next life.
However, in the case of the infinite expansion of the universe around the lifeticle, nothing alike, and this also resets time.
This option may not work in a cyclic universe, as there is no infinite expansion, and activity that generates qualia may remain around the lifeticle.
It is possible that during sleep, one might feel something but not remember it. The sensation of time passing instantly could be the result of the lack of memory.
As a counterargument - in sleep, there are no random sensations, and the speed of time can vary.
If a person does not want to experience sensations, disabling the generation of qualia by the brain is not a solution; 
a minimum level of qualia is necessary for time not to pass instantly. This option is excluded due to the uncertainty about what causes qualia.
This may indicate an unlikely error in the article, for which there are no visible reasons.
This is necessary for the introduction of "zero eternity," but it does not affect the overall concept.

========================

Qualia space

Distance

If to hit on a leg, there arises a sensation of pain, and this pain is felt at a distance from the brain.
It turns out that in the brain exists a definition of at what distance and in what place the pain is located.
This means that it is possible to change this definition and set the distance to a kilometer, and then the pain will indeed be felt at a distance of a kilometer.

Position in space

Qualia, despite the fact that they cannot be expressed through other entities, have their position in space.
But they are definitely not located in the exact space where they are felt - otherwise, the pain in the leg should be located directly in the leg, 
instead a signal comes from the leg to the brain
It can be assumed that they operate at the atomic level, for example: a distance of 1 meter is 1 thousandth of an atom, 
a sensation at a distance of a kilometer is at a distance of an atom.
In this case, you cannot feel anything further than a kilometer.
Qualia have a real spatial location, but the size of this is very small, qualia are smaller than a molecule.
As you grow older, objects are felt to be of a different size, and even if there is a separate area of space around the lifeticle and the sizes of sensations are larger, 
then they still do not correspond to real sizes, but are relative.
Furthermore, one's own spatial domain is a more complex structure.
An experiment on creating pain at a distance and studying a qualia generator could help clarify the question and the distance limit.

Space

Qualia space may be connected to real space.
This may mean that qualia cannot participate in 4-dimensional space.
Space can be distorted according to the theory of relativity. How is this related to qualia space?
1) The qualia field has its own internal space
2) The qualia field itself is distorted along with the distortion of space, and for example, a huge gravitational wave can distort the image.

Angle of rotation

The image sent from the eye: its left part on the left, the right part on the right.
You can close your eyes and visualize this.
You can shift it to the right - then the left part will be in the center, the central part on the right, and the right part sideways to the right.
The fact that qualia have a position means that the field qualia possesses a direction that has a center.
If the position of qualia is determined by the position in space, the rotation angles of the lifeticle field’s direction must be maintained in accordance with spatial rotations.
If qualia are aligned with the brain, the angle of the lifeticle field corresponds to the brain; if misaligned, the angle does not match the brain.
If the location of qualia is set by a parameter, the angle of the lifeticle field may not align with the brain and can be rotated, shifted sideways, or flipped.
Maintaining the angle of the lifeticle requires separate functionality, which suggests that the coordinate of qualia is most likely set by a parameter, not a spatial coordinate.
The direction of the qualia field is similar to the spin of a particle.

Multilayer image

Is it possible to create qualia of a volumetric image with multiple layers? One object is visible behind another, and they do not overlap.
The brain can create a volumetric image of no more than one layer due to evolutionary reasons.
The question pertains not to the brain, but to the very nature of qualia.
At the same time, the image layer does not appear as something that occupies volume, 
as if there are two size parameters - height and width - while the third parameter, depth, is absent.

========================

Qualia's connection to cosmic destiny

Robots

A scenario of a cyclic universe that does not fully contract, leaving room for a robot.
A single self-replicating robot is enough to prevent life from emerging.
This scenario of an incomplete cyclic universe is equivalent to the scenario of an infinitely expanding universe, since in both cases life can no longer exist.

Cyclicality

Robots can destroy life.
If the universe is cyclic - this allows the robots to be destroyed, but it leads again to an evolutionary path.
There is no scenario where robots are destroyed without a new evolutionary path emerging.
This may mean that full happiness does not exist in the world.
This highlights the importance of creating an organization to monitor artificial intelligence or other possible transitions into negative qualia states.

========================

Lifeticle

The term life

The term "Life" lacks a precise definition and will be redefined.
"Life" will signify the presence of an active subject/phenomenal consciousness/so-called observer/lifticle.
Without it, an organism will be referred to as a biorobot.

The meaning of life

A violation of the internal causal chain in the existence of the lifeticle: if there were an external cause for its creation, 
this would imply that the lifeticle already exists, i.e., it is its own cause for existence - as if it created itself, which is a paradox.
This also means that it cannot not exist.
This also answers the question of the meaning of life: the purpose of the lifticle’s creation is the meaning of life, but since the lifticle’s existence is a paradox, 
the meaning of life lies in the paradox.
At the same time, there are directions of life: happiness/positive qualia, pain/negative qualia, and "zero eternity".

Status

In the status of death, it might be indicated: central particle/lifeticle: saved/lost.

The fate of the lifeticle

If the deceased could not be cryonized upon death, their ashes can be scattered either on the ground or at sea.
It is preferable to scatter the ashes on land, 
as the probability of being reborn as a terrestrial life form is higher than as an aquatic one - likely a comparison of one in a million to one in a billion.
However, the lifeticle may potentially escape in the smoke during cremation, creating ambiguity in this recommendation.
Despite the ambiguity, this factor redefines the optimal location for scattering the ashes, and the answer is - on land.
If the organism was not cryonized and if physical laws permit and the theory is proven, instead of memorial ashes, the lifeticle could be stored in a mold.

Biorobots

The answer to the question of what a lifeticle is and how qualia are triggered will also answer the question of whether viruses or biorobots are considered alive.

Atom

In the brain, no other attached particles occupying volume have been found.
This may suggest that the lifeticle is located within an atom.
In this case, the lifeticle does not need to be moved to appear in the brain during its formation.
It is more complex for the lifeticle to end up in the brain through the process of evolutionary brain development.
However, if it were located within an atom, this additional complexity would be unneeded.

The ship of theseus

The problem of the Ship of Theseus lies only in the fact that we define what we call a "ship".
From a physics perspective, when planks are transferred to another ship, it would be correct to say that one ship is 80% the Ship of Theseus, and the other is 20%.
In the case of a living organism, the key factor is the subject (the main particle) - whether it remains the same subject.

Stars

Carbon atoms are synthesized in stars.
If the lifeticle is inside an atom or was in stars for other reason, and if the stars' environment generates qualia for the lifeticle, 
then there may have already been quasi-life within the stars with a random and unknown level of qualia.
The same question applies to the early universe in the first hundreds of thousands of years before the epoch of primordial recombination, when the universe became transparent to electromagnetic radiation.

Multiplicity of consciousness

The idea of multiple consciousnesses, where many lifeticles exist in the brain and experience the same qualia, requires identical qualia to be generated for several lifeticles.
This idea is structurally more complex, both in terms of evolution and considering the influence of the lifeticle itself, 
and there are no reasons for such complexity; the idea is evolutionarily improbable.

The problem of indivisible structure

An image can disappear, which means it is not part of the lifeticle but rather some external functionality.
And the lifeticle itself has an influence on the world.
Such a particle appears to resemble a kind of micro-brain with its own functionality - otherwise, it wouldn't work, and this creates the problem of indivisible structure.
This problem also exists in elementary particles: an electron has properties such as momentum (direction and speed), charge, spin, interactions with other particles, etc.
If an elementary particle had no properties, it would exist without interacting with the world and would not be part of it.
In Wolfram’s theory, the elements of the hypergraph, from which elementary particles are composed, also have multiple properties.
Perhaps this is a fundamental requirement; otherwise, reality would not form.

Elementary particles

When questioning what the lifeticle is, one might ask: are the actions of elementary particles actually living actions rather than automatic ones? Several points argue against this.
They perform actions, but phenomenal consciousness does not perform any such actions.
Quarks are far too small relative to atoms, which are likely the level at which qualia generation occurs.
Space itself is something.
It is difficult to imagine that the elements composing space are alive, or that qualia could be directed to such elements.
Qualia appear as a non-living, automatic mechanism.
This shows that reality functions independently of consciousness.
If we are in a virtual reality, this applies to the base reality as well - life and independent elementary particles exist there.
As a counterargument, the function of lifeticle attachment is automatic.
The fact that the lifeticle has physical properties in some way brings the world/reality and consciousness closer together,
 which may raise the question of whether elementary particles are alive.
The theory is compatible with panpsychism concerning elementary particles, provided this does not contradict quantum field theory.
In a completed physical theory, the phenomenon of qualia must be present.
Either a lifeticle particle must be discovered, or the property of qualia must be defined as a characteristic of an elementary particle.

Philosophical zombie

A philosophical zombie is not physically identical to a human since it lacks the lifeticle, which has physical properties.

The beginning of existence

If the moment when the lifeticle begins to exist is neither the moment of birth nor during the nine months of pregnancy, then what moment could it be?
In reverse time, it cannot be infinite - that would be a paradox: no matter how far back time is rewound, there would still be more time remaining.
But this would also mean that an infinite amount of time has already passed, which is impossible.
The answer implies that the universe has a beginning of time, and one might assume that this is also the beginning of the lifeticle's existence.
The idea that existence begins at birth does not make sense, since the organism is constructed from particles that already existed before; 
birth is simply the movement of certain atoms/particles from one position to another.
Some physicists suggest that in reverse time, time itself is circular at its origin, making it potentially infinite - it loops back on itself.
In one direction, there is a starting point, while in the other, an endless circular loop.
Such an idea somewhat addresses the question of the universe's starting point in time.

Other lifeticles

How is it possible that there are other lifeticles with the same properties? Does this mean they share something in common - a shared paradox? But they are separate particles.
A possible solution would be if the universe has an end of time, and at the end of time, the lifeticle moves backward in time and lives other lives.
This would mean that if you hit someone,you will either feel the pain in their place or have already felt it earlier.
The problem with this idea is that the universe would need to have an endpoint, which would also include some function that transfers the lifeticle back in time.

Number of lifeticles

Is the number of lifeticles in reality limited?
The diameter of the universe is at least 40 times larger than the observable universe, and it is unknown whether it is infinite.
If it is infinite, then the number of subjects would also be unlimited.
The question of whether other universes exist is equivalent to asking whether there is more space with matter somewhere else in the universe if its size is finite.

========================

Incompatibility with other theories

Everett's many-worlds interpretation

The influence of qualia on the collapse of the wave function negates Everett's many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.
It is also poorly compatible with lifeticles, since a lifeticle cannot be copied.
The idea that a lifeticle exists simultaneously in two or more worlds and lives parallel lives in parallel worlds is meaningless.
Either the lifeticle already existed in this world before the split (which would mean there were multiple lifeticles occupying the same place at once),
or lifeticles do not exist in other worlds, which requires that when worlds split, lifeticles go into only one world - or that the interpretation itself is incorrect.

Wolfram's theory

The hypergraph elements in Wolfram's theory are too small relative to the size of an atom to be the main particle of an organism.
In that case, apart from the hypergraph, there must also be life particles that attach to the organism,
but they cannot attach to elements of the hypergraph that are too small.
This may indicate that Wolfram's theory is incorrect.

If the qualia field is three-dimensional, it is poorly connected with Wolfram's theory:
In Wolfram's theory, space can have any number of dimensions.
Either the qualia field is compatible only with a specific form of hypergraph space, or the theory is incorrect.
This may also require two separate entities for space - hypergraph space and qualia space.

CEMI theory

For the correctness of the theory, information must be transferred to the quantum level, the receiver of which must be the lifeticle.
